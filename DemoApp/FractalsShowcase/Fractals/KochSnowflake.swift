/**
 * Koch Snowflake Fractal
 *
 * The Koch Snowflake is a fractal curve created by applying the Koch curve
 * construction to each side of an equilateral triangle. It's one of the earliest
 * fractals discovered and demonstrates how simple rules create complex patterns.
 *
 * Mathematical Foundation:
 * - Start with an equilateral triangle
 * - Replace each side with a Koch curve
 * - The Koch curve rule: divide each line into thirds, replace middle third
 *   with two sides of an equilateral triangle
 * - Each iteration adds more detail to the boundary
 * - The process continues recursively to the desired depth
 *
 * Properties:
 * - Fractal dimension = log(4)/log(3) â‰ˆ 1.262
 * - Self-similar at all scales
 * - Has finite area but infinite perimeter
 * - Exhibits perfect six-fold symmetry
